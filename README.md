<strong>Problem 1.</strong>

<ul>

 <li>Use Tensorflow to construct a computation graph that performs training and predictionfor the MNIST dataset, with the following specifications:

  <ul>

   <li>Single layer, 10 neurons, softmax + cross entropy objective function.</li>

   <li>Three layers, [(50, ReLU), (50, ReLU), (10, Linear)], softmax + cross entropyobjective function. Use Stochastic Gradient Descent with minibatch size of 500.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Use Keras (either plain Keras or tf.keras from Tensorflow 2.0) to redo the above twoexercises.</li>

</ul>
